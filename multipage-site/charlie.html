    <div class="helvetica"><p>Charlotte Morningstar, more commonly known as Charlie, is the Hellborn princess of Hell, the founder of the Hazbin Hotel, and the main protagonist of Hazbin Hotel. Charlie is optimistic and cares deeply for the well-being of her people. The estranged daughter of Lucifer and Lilith, Charlie wants to do right by her kingdom and find a way to redeem Sinners into Heaven through rehabilitation at the Hazbin Hotel. She is voiced by Erika Henningsen in the Amazon Prime series.</p>

    <div class="helvetica"><p>Charlie is the only character in the main cast who is a native hellborn demon, and therefore, not having been previously human. When asked if Charlie has a true and full-fledged demon form, or if it only appears when she's extremely angry, Vivziepop said that she does, but would not elaborate further. Charlie has been stated to be "a tall girl" and is taller than her father, Lucifer. Not by a large amount, but still notable, with Charlie standing at around 6ft, or possibly over. Charlie's design is inspired by Vaudeville-style porcelain dolls, puppets, marionette-type things, and to a lesser extent goats. Vivziepop described Charlie's nose as being like a lamb or puppy dog, that looks very animal-like from the side, even though her character is mostly humanoid/marionette.</p>
