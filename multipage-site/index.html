    <div class="helvetica"><p>Hazbin Hotel is an American adult animated musical comedy streaming television series created by <a href="vivziepop.html">Vivienne "VivziePop" Medrano</a>. The series revolves around the quest to find a way for sinners in Hell to be "rehabilitated" and allowed into Heaven, via the "Hazbin Hotel," as an alternative to Heaven's annual "Extermination" of wayward souls due to Hell's overpopulation. The series is produced by independent entertainment company A24 and animation studio Bento Box Entertainment, in collaboration with Amazon Studios.</p></div>

    <div class="helvetica"><p>The pilot episode, which was released on YouTube on October 28, 2019, was made entirely by freelance animators and was largely financed by Medrano's Patreon followers. The first season premiered on Amazon Prime Video on January 18, 2024, with its first episode also released on YouTube on that same day for a limited release. On January 26, 2024, it was revealed that Hazbin Hotel is the largest global debut for a new animated series on Prime Video.</p></div>
