    <div class="helvetica"><p>Anthony "Angel Dust" or simply Angel, is a gay spider demon, an adult entertainer, and the first volunteer for Charlie's rehabilitation program. He does not take Charlie's cause seriously, and tends to get into mischief behind her back. He is in an abusive relationship with his boss, Valentino. Despite his insolence, he genuinely cares about his friends and strives to better himself, even if he is not keen on showing his softer side. "Angel Dust" is Angel's chosen all-encompassing persona name, and one he uses exclusively in place of his actual name. It is intended as multipurpose for both his his sex-work persona and a slang term for phencyclidine (PCP), his current addiction and possible reference to his mode of death, a drug overdose. He is voiced by Blake Roman in the Amazon Prime series.</p>
    
    <div class="helvetica"><p>Vivziepop describes Angel as somewhat like the Hell-equivalent to Paris Hilton or the Kardashians, in that he is a well-known star of a particular type in this world. Adult-film actors are the regular stars of Hell, and Angel is one of the bigger stars working at one of the biggest studios. Angel's fluffy chest and femme-embracing style is often a point of confusion among fans of the show, as well as characters within the show itself. Vivziepop clarified within pilot development streams that Angel is, in fact, a cisgendered man who is just proud of his androgynous look and enjoys playing around with that, in both his day-to-day attire and his drag persona.</p>
