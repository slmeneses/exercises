    <div class="helvetica"><p>Alastor, also known as the Radio Demon, is an eccentric overlord of Hell, who vanished seven years before the events of the pilot. He was once a radio broadcaster in the 1930s, and is now a demon with deer characteristics. His voice has an effect which imitates radio static, complete with sound effects and theme music. His charming and elegant exterior hides a twisted and sadistic mindset. He offers his powers to Charlie to help her maintain her goal of running the hotel, but only for his own amusement, as he enjoys watching demons struggle to redeem themselves only to fall from grace He is voiced by Amir Talai in the Amazon Prime series.</p>
    
    <div class="helvetica"><p>In both life and death, Alastor was a radio show host and prolific serial killer. Vivziepop describes him as "living his best life" while a radio star. He is also shown to be quite a cunning individual, resulting in him accruing a large amount of power through his sadistic tendencies, tricks and deal-making. Vivziepop declined to give out details of Alastor's killings, but described him as "not going after just anyone," highlighting his "weird moral code." She has emphasized him not being a direct parallel to any real world serial killer, but instead describing him as sharing some similarities with the fictional serial killer, Dexter. </p>
